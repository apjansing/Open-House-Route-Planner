# Open House Route Planner Contributing Guidelines

I would like to limit the project to myself until after May 2019; as this is a project for school and need to do it on my own. Until that date, I would prefer any contributions to be limited to bug reports and suggested features.

That being said, if you have suggestions on how to improve my existing code, I welcome any and all constructive critism and sugestions.
