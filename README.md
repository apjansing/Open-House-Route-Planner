# Open House Router

I have been looking for houses. When I add open houses to my Google Calendar, I am able to request direction to whatever house is open next in time, but I was thinking… “What if two houses are significantly far apart, open at similar times, and there are other houses in each of their respective neighborhoods that open at different times? Is there a way I can plan my day of house hunting so that I can attend all of the open houses?”
