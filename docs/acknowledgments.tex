This work is dedicated to my parents. Without their guidance, I would not be the person I am today. I joined the United States Air Force after their suggestion, where I gained a greater appreciation for my education and the opportunities afforded to me.

I would like to thank each of my committee members: 

Gerard Aiken supplied the Esri ArcGIS Developer credits required to do this work.

I would also like to acknowledge Jennifer Tran, Sylvia Pericles, Zhushun Cai, and Oliver Medonza for aiding the initial code base where we won the Esri API Prize and the Grand Prize at Hack Upstate XI.

This work was funded by Booz Allen Hamilton tuition assistance program.
