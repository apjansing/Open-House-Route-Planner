Alexander Jansing's interest in Computer Science started early; at the age of 4. The first computer his family had had two $5.25"$ floppy drives and the operating system needed to be loaded into memory at boot. He used that computer to teach himself some basic command line operations and played games like chess. Seeing this interest in computer and logic, his parents started teaching him basic math before he even entered school. He built his first PC when he was 8 years-old and took as many Mathematics, Computer Science, Digital Electronics, and various science courses as he could in grade school. This fascination with mathematical concepts continued through his education and subsequent careers as an F-16 avionics technician, data scientist, and software engineer while working for the United States Air Force, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Lockheed Martin, respectively. He received a Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics from SUNY Oswego and is pursuing a Masters of Science in Computer and Information Sciences at SUNY Polytechnic Institute.
